Minutes 1 from January 27th 2017 meeting:

This was our first meeting with our Teacher's Assistant and we spoke about our idea StudyRing and asked for his opinion.


New business: Proposed two ideas; more user friendly merger of myConcordia and Moodle, second idea was a web app that can find or create study rooms to study for a course of your choice.

For both ideas we would have to create an extra database which would store schedules as well as favourited locations to study.

Decided on the study room app and are going to create a website with a domain instead of creating a web app. The website will require a login and password that can be saved and will allow the user to search by school for courses. Creation of issues and first story of implementation.

For the login, we are deciding on JavaScript for the implementation and use NodeJS to run the website more smoothly.

Old business: Nothing to report since the last meeting on January 20th.
