This meeting was our Sprint 3 meeting with the TA.

Meeting Duration: 1:16pm - 1:27pm

What we showed the TA during the Sprint meeting were as follows:

Showed forgot password functionality, explained how the code worked, demos the method to create and join ring as well as how the ring shows the members.

Showed burndown, TA was confused how we got to 300 hours, we have to show work planned not the capacity (300 hours is capacity not how much work we planned for the sprint as an estimate)


After showing the Sprint 3, the TA gave us some insight for future Sprints:

TA thinks we did he burndown wrong again, need to change it to hours expected not actual hours taken and for the sprint only as well as a burndown chart for the entire project at the end before presenting.

We need at least 1 unit test because for sprint 4 we need many
