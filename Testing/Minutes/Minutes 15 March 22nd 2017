This meeting was an online discussion over Discord text caht.
Meeting Duration: 2:48pm - 4:16pm


-We spoke about some of the bugs that we encountered during pair programming sessions.

-Decided on a more structured method of formatting the entire project as well as the standard for all of our comments.

-Fixed the bug with avatar pictures not showing up on the main page but displayed a broken link placeholder.

-Created a method that checks if the user is the Ring Owner or another person who joined the Ring later on to implement a method to check who is the owner and who else can have access the Ring.
