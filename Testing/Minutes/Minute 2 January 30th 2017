We set up a domain which will be available at: studyring.tk

We decided to split the project into three different stages: Groups, Events and the Database.

Groups 
- Most groups will be public, but private groups is a feature to be implemented later on
- Groups will have tags which will help users find them 

Events
- Cap limit of people

Database
- Using user.txt for the database of usernames and password, but eventually we need to choose whether we will use Mongodb or mySQL for the groups and events database and upgrade.
